In particular, she served as a translator for a postpartum psychiatric patient. In this role, she was empathetic and followed directions. She took feedback well and immediately implemented changes.

We discussed some strategies for organizing his presentation in order to become more independent in making a thorough assessment and formulating a plan based on prior workup.  Based on our conversation (not direct observation), I suspect that  likely needs to become more familiar with the roles of his non-MD colleagues in order to successfully collaborate with those individuals.

Appreciated that he kept things succinct given that the patient was just presented at 7:15 am rounds, however would be nice to still include an abbreviated version of the pertinent positive or negative labs that would then contribute to his interpretation or assessment of the patient (this may have been my fault for saying don't re-present the patient...). As far as that assessment, I think  was nearly there in getting it all together and into context - next steps would be to organize his thoughts around it. By this I mean, all the pertinent diagnoses or differential diagnoses were mentioned, but was not quite linear or logical in the explanation or presentation (A lead to diagnosis B which also contributed to C, but since he has history of X we were also worried about Y...). Going off of this, the organization would then lend itself to the presentation of the plan - can do by systems or problem, but be consistent and stick to the order. I think  will definitely get there, just a bit more practice. If any of this doesn't make sense, happy to go over this presentation in person."

Interval events were appropriate- could've also mentioned less distention. If there is a hospital course section (not always necessary, probably useful for this prolonged admission), most people put that before interval events, and it's usually more of a summary instead of a play-by-play. Be careful saying last revision was 11/18...that could imply it was 2 months ago, and not November 2018. The hospital course should also be separated by problem or system, with the most important stuff first. There is a section in the middle about his diagnosis of CKD which is better being a separate paragraph and probably just one line...don't need to discuss how that diagnosis was made in a hospital course section. There were also discharge goals and followup plans in this section, which don't belong here, they belong in the assessment and plan. You also don't need a brief HPI and a hospital course section...they are the same thing, so this is redundant. Respiratory exam mentions abnormal lung sounds, but this is the least important part of this exam- need to mention if there is increased respiratory effort (retractions, flaring, grunting, head bobbing, tachypnea) and how the air movement is. Summary statement in the assessment doesn't need to repeat all his chronic medical problems...can call him medically complex and just include the pertinent medical history. The assessment also says he is still on 10L HFNC, which is incorrect. Assessment should include an assessment of his volume status especially since he has HOCM and CKD. Can make notes more concise by avoiding redundancy- nephrology followup was mentioned twice in the plan. Look at your entire note everyday to see what needs to be updated"

You did a great job of collecting information from the chart and patient independently, and giving the right amount of detail during rounds. Continue to focus on big picture items, and have in your back pocket one or two things that you may be asked on rounds. Also, after a lengthy presentation that has to be detailed as yours was, it would be ok to recap the major plan for the day. Something like: ""today need to stay on top of his fluid status and urine output and creatinine"". this reorients the team and attending and shows that you can zoom back out to the big picture quickly. great job"

It is important to know he was intubated at one point, was hallucinating and aggressive at some points, also during his hospital stay, but as those aren't active issues, I wouldn't include in the daily assessment.

Student demonstrated some open ended styles of history taking like “tell me more about the shortness of breath”.  I would encourage the same approach for the cough (instead of check list, “tell me about the cough”).  Try not to be presumptive (“Do you get more shortness of breath at night?”) or provide choices if you don’t have to. (“is the shortness of breath from your lung not expanding well or that you have to sit down”)  Good echo technique summarizing the timeline of events.  Avoid being suggestive “have you been immobilized more lately and do you think that is contributing to the shortness of breath”.  Ask about sick contact and flu shot in relation to DDx of pneumonia/URI.  Dig in a bit more about PE risk factors post op.  || On Exam, we shared tips on looking at JVD and accessing the LLSB/apex more easily.  Remember to auscultate the abdomen before palpation.  Remember to listen lower for lung exams as lower lobe is deeper than we think.  || Student has a gentle tone/personality and was able to connect well with the patient and his wife who started with being a little annoyed that they are interviewed by multiple folks to being appreciate of the thoroughness of the team.

Technically PICO should be made BEFORE the study is acquired, not to be used to summarize the study.  In which case your I should just be IV acetaminophen and C would be Placebo.  Correct answer re: concealment (have to infer based on computer generation) but required some guidance during discussion.   Re baseline characteristics, the differences in the categories you pointed out seem not to be statistically significant, but would be nice to see the P values/equivalent.  Re: equal treatment, my interpretation is that the banned administration of acetaminophen was universal for all groups.  If they did not account for the patient who withdrew, they may still be able to claim modified intention to treat but may not be a true intention to treat.  Have to round up NNT.  The CI was moderately wide.  I would not call it precise.  The 18.3 has to be within the CI so it doesn’t help with determination of precision.  "

For the i, perhaps suffice to say ""virtual game on electronic device + standard care"", and C should be ""standard care"".  Question 2: I think suffices to say patients (adults?) that require outpatient antibiotic therapy (the parenteral part is your intervention, the complications is outcome?).  Your I then is parenteral Abx with midline or central line, your C should be Oral antibiotic therapy.  Your O should just be rates of complications.  Question3: for the O, just write subjective measures of vaccine hesitancy.

Good job introducing self and position - make sure to do this even on patients who you have been seeing for multiple days since they see a ton of folks each day. You have a calm and comforting bedside manner that will serve you well. Make sure to ""set up the room"" for optimal success -- turning on lights, turning off TV, and in this case removing a neb that was finished but still very loud. Morning interview shouldn't necessarily be rehashing the entire presentation even if it is your first time to see them, ok to ask a few questions to clarify presentation or if there were things in the documentation that were unclear, but mostly it should focus on interval and overnight events as well as focused symptoms. Good job pivoting to ROS questions when patient was confused. Good focused physical exam, though need to make sure to auscultate lungs in patient with pneumonia. It is helpful to think before you enter the room what focused ROS you don't want to miss and what physical exam systems you want to look at based on their presenting illness. Make sure to ask the patient if ""anything happened overnight"" as well as if they have any questions as both of these things are high yield questions to ask. Timing wise it took you a little long but not overly so, should aim for 5-10 minutes at bedside on the majority of patients in the morning and you took 14. Remember that part of your morning interview should also include finding the bedside nurse and asking if they have anything they want to pass on to the team."

Say problem x is likely from ""a"" because ___.  plan 1 is testing for that and treating it, in case it is due to ""b"" we are doing thing 2.

You are a comfortable presenter and overall are doing a great job. Make sure to briefly include the ""why"" of specific interventions to show you thought it out. Try as much as you can to have plans clearly thought out before presenting, for example in one instance today you were thinking through whether or not to discontinue duonebs with appropriate reasoning, but on rounds ideally you want to fairly quickly state your plan in a confident manner, such as ""discontinue duonebs because patient is not wheezing and this is not a COPD exacerbation"" and spend less time thinking about it out loud. I don't remember word for word but you said something along the lines of ""I think that we can probably stop the duonebs, I don't think that he really needs them, he is getting them every six hours, he only has a mild cough, he hasn't been wheezing this admission, they don't seem to really be helping"""

The patient includes and excludes whatever facts they fell are relevant or irrelevant and sometimes chooses to exclude facts they know are relevant.  It is the Practioner's job to first elicit all the relevant information, then reorganize the relevant information into a chronological and systematic summary.  Without all the relevant information in an organized context, the exam becomes an expedition without focus rather than an extension of the history to confirm and refute the differential already developing.    Student is doing fine but exam is still not adequate to identify subtle pathology.  It takes more than practice/going thru the motions.  At this stage (M3), while examining a patient, while imagining the exam, the student must mindfully consider why this is part of the exam, how doing this part of the exam properly may elicit findings (and just going thru the motions might not), what that part of the exam is testing (usually many things), and what the overall categorical differential of an abnormal finding means. Again, this is level of proficiency is normal for the  M3 year. Improving ones professional skills including conducting an exam is a life long journey.

You had a calm and caring demeanor and the pt felt comfortable. Things to work on: make sure to try and complete a full section of the interview before jumping to the next session, not because it's necessarily wrong to go out of order, but because we all have a tendency to leave out important parts because we don't remember to go back and ask. So for example I would try to get all your SIGECAPS knocked out before you jump to past psych hx and social. Obviously some things will come up out of order if the pt brings it up. Being flexible and fluid with the interview order is a great skill to have, but that's if you can remember not to leave out key points. Also, don't forget to check at least orientation & attention as part of every mental status exam (one of those things that for some reason is easy to forget!)."
