The demand forecast for a particular night is 130 rentals in the Super Saver class, 60 in the Deluxe class, and 50 in the Business class. Since these are the forecasted demands, Round Tree will take no more than these amounts of each reservation for each rental class. Round Tree has a limited number of each type of room.
